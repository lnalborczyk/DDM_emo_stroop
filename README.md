# Effect of spatially filtered primes on emotion categorization with an interference context in autism and typically developing

This repository contains the supplementary materials of the paper entitled *Effect of spatially filtered primes on emotion categorization with an interference context in autism and typically developing* and authored by Lacroix et al.

It describes, amongst other things, the joint modelling of accuracy and reaction times using Bayesian hierarchical diffusion decision models in `R` and `Stan` using the `brms` package.
