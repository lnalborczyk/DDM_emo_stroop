# Supplementary materials to 'Different processing of spatial frequencies in autism spectrum compared to control suggested by an emotional stroop with filtered primes'

This repository contains the supplementary materials to the paper "Different processing of spatial frequencies in autism spectrum compared to control suggested by an emotional Stroop with filtered primes". It describes, amongst other things, the joint modelling of accuracy and reaction times using Bayesian hierarchical diffusion decision models in Stan using the brms package.
